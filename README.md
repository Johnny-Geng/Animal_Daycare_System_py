# Animal_Daycare_System_py
This program written in Python is a simulation of an animal daycare system.<br/>

## Logistics:
The program reads data from the animal.csv file, which serves to give an example of several random animals with different initial values of categories like hunger, happiness, energy, and age, as well as their name and species. Depending on how you choose to interact with animals (play, feed, give medicine, sleep, etc.), the corresponding index of animals will change accordingly. 

## Purpose:
This program is designed to demonstrate the basic knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python.
